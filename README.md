# Computer & Communication Networks [COMP3234]

This repository holds the teaching materials for the course Computer & Communication Networks taught at The University of Hong Kong for the fall 2023-24 semseter. This course was taught by Chuan Wu alongside the tutorial team consisting of Shiwei Zhang, Guicheng Qi and Borui Wan to whom I am indebted for helping me work through some difficult problems.

The course covers the foundations of networking, its applications and the architecture of the internet. The course largely follows the textbook, "Computer Networking: A Top Down Appraoach" authored by Jim Kurose and Keith W. Ross. It's a somewhat terse book and someone interested in learning the course content is better served by either following along the video lectures covering the same content taught bby Prof. Jim Kurose himself (or use other sources).

This course has 1 programming assignment, 3 written assignments and 5 labs. It also had a mid-term exam and a final exam.

You can easily find the assignment problems and their suggested solutions in their respective folders. Lecture slides and labs have also been provided. 

The source code for my implementation of a Instant Messaging app that inlcludes basic chatrooms etc is also provided.
